    <!-- Hello, This is the starting part of the paragraph -->

    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. It structures content on the web by using a series of elements or tags that define the layout and appearance of text, images, links, and other multimedia. HTML is foundational to web development, allowing browsers to interpret and render content in a readable format for users. Elements in HTML are usually enclosed in angle brackets, with tags such as <p> for paragraphs, <h1> to <h6> for headings, and <a> for links. For example, the <img> tag is used to embed images, while <table> helps create tables. HTML is a static language, but it can be paired with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to improve styling and layout.<br>
     Additionally, HTML works with JavaScript to introduce interactivity. This combination makes it possible to build dynamic and responsive web applications. HTML5, the latest version, introduced new features such as audio and video support without plugins. Understanding HTML is essential for anyone working in web development, from beginners to advanced developers.
